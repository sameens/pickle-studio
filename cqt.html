      <h1>Culture Quest Tours</h1>
      <p>
        Culture Quest Tours (CQT) is founded by a tour leader and world traveler to provide live virtual tours and experiences to people around the world.
         An affordable and comfortable way to get a feeling for a new place and learn about it.

        I helped them re-design the site (~20 pages). I also participated in conceptualizing their future product that included self-paced tours and experiences. <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        I did an initial round of user tests to figure out what worked and didn't work with the original site,
        helped with thinking about different audiences,their needs and their journeys throught the site and booking process.
        I also worked with their developers throught the implementation.
