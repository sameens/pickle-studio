      <h1>Baaham Online</h1>
      <p>
        Baaham Online is a platform with a mission to provide affordable and accessible mental health care to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have designed and built the site from scratch using wordpress. Currently users can book appointments with therapists
        and new online courses is being launched soon (it's still user development so I'm only able to provide a few screenshots). <br/>
